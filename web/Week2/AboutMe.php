    <div>
        <p>My name is Jacob Thomas. I am a software engineering major in my last year at BYUI. I will graduate at the
            end of spring 2020. I currently work at Melaleuca as a QA tester.
            I live in Rexburg near porter park with my wife and daugher. She is new to the family and only 1.5 years
            old. We enjoy playing together at home and at the park. We are excited
            for the cooler weather! <p>
